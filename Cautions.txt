*Installation of tensorflow(backend) and keras

     1. tensorflow only supports 3.4,3.5,3.6 python versions
     2. without anaconda virtualenv has to be setup, lot of environment variables as well. bit cumbersome work
     3. with anaconda install python 3.6 and not python 3.7. Python 3.7 is not supported by tensorflow.
     4. while installing through anaconda, after typing conda activate tensorflow , install tensorflow and insatll keras in that prompt only. Do not exit and come out of conda activate 
        tensorflow after installing tensorflow. 
*when importing with include_top = true classes should be 1000 and not 5
     5. Notebooks remain running until you explicitly shut them down; closing the notebook's page is not sufficient.
     6. After removing weights create new model and add the pretrained model with new model initialized with sequential() because only sequential() func has add func.
     7. specify input_shape in retrieving pretrained model.
     8. labels should be categorial. shape should ne [no of samples,1].
